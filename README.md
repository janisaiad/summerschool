## 📝 Description

This project implements modern neural network architectures for operator modeling and solving partial differential equations (PDEs). It is developed in collaboration with Professors Hadrien Montanelli and Samuel Kokh.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Implement and compare two deep learning architectures for operator modeling:
  - **DeepONet** (Deep Operator Network) - To learn operators between function spaces
  - **FNO** (Fourier Neural Operator) - To leverage spectral analysis in operator modeling

- Apply these architectures to solving partial differential equations (PDEs), with a particular focus on the heat equation

## 🧠 Key Concepts

- **Operator Modeling**: Learning to map functional input spaces to functional output spaces
- **Spectral Analysis**: Using Fourier transforms to efficiently capture spatial dynamics
- **Supervised Learning**: Training on input-output pairs generated by classical numerical solvers

## 📊 Data Format

Training data is structured in triplets (mu, x, sol) where:
- `mu` represents input functions (e.g., boundary conditions, initial conditions)
- `x` represents points in the spatial domain
- `sol` represents expected solutions at points `x`

## 🚀 Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- TensorFlow 2.8+
- Virtual environment (recommended)

### Installation Steps

1. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/janisaiad/sciml.git
   cd sciml
   ```

2. Set up the environment and install dependencies
   ```bash
   chmod +x launch.sh
   ./launch.sh
   ```

3. Activate the virtual environment
   ```bash
   source .venv/bin/activate  # For Linux/MacOS
   # or
   .\.venv\Scripts\activate   # For Windows
   ```

## 📚 Usage

### Data Generation

Data generation scripts are located in the `data/generation/` directory. Example usage:

```bash
python data/generation/generate_big_heat_fno.py
```

### Training Models

```python
from sciml.model.fno import FNO
from sciml.model.deeponet import DeepONet

# Configure and train FNO
fno_model = FNO(hyper_params, regular_params, fourier_params)
fno_model.fit()

# Configure and train DeepONet
deeponet_model = DeepONet(hyper_params, regular_params)
deeponet_model.fit()
```

### Example Notebooks

Several notebooks are available to demonstrate model usage:

- For DeepONet: `notebooks/deeponet/TORUNDEEPONETCOMPARISON.ipynb`
- For FNO: `notebooks/fno/TORUNFNO.ipynb`

### Converting Notebooks with Jupytext

To convert all notebooks to Python files:

```bash
find . -name "*.ipynb" -type f -exec jupytext --to py {} \;
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with JAX/JAXlib during FNO model training, try the following commands:

```bash
# Activate virtual environment if not already done
source .venv/bin/activate

# Uninstall current versions
uv pip uninstall jax jaxlib

# Install compatible versions
uv add jax
uv add jaxlib==0.4.17
```

## 📝 Research Notes and Observations

### FNO Performance
- Too many Fourier layers destabilize training
- Consider sequential temporal inference
- Test on other data (naca)

### DeepONet Improvements
- Compare with RB and POD
- Test alternative branch/trunk architectures

### Spectral Analysis
- Impact of Fourier layer count on generalization
- Compare Fourier weights between layers
- Verify cast/coeff and phase multiplication
